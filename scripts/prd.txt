Project: Facebook Data GUI Builder

Problem Statement:
Marketing analysts need a simple way to select which Facebook Ads Insights metrics they want, query the API, and export the data to JSON without writing code.

Goals / In‑Scope:
1. Provide a lightweight GUI allowing users to:
   • Authenticate with Meta (input access token, app id, secret, ad account id).
   • Select date range and attribution window.
   • Pick insight fields via checkboxes/search.
   • Optional breakdown selections (age, gender, placement…).
   • Trigger data fetch and display results in a table.
   • Export results to downloadable JSON file.
2. Use latest facebook‑business‑sdk.
3. Build GUI with Streamlit (fast, deployable, python‑native).
4. Package as pip‑installable app with `requirements.txt`.

Out‑of‑Scope:
• Persisting state in a database.
• Multi‑user auth flow (we'll rely on manual token input for v1).
• Scheduling / cron jobs (future).

Success Metrics:
• User can fetch data and download JSON in < 3 min without code.
• Handles at least 100K insight rows without crash.

Assumptions & Constraints:
• User already has valid access token.
• Single ad account per session.

Milestones:
1. Project scaffold & dependencies.
2. Build basic Streamlit form to input creds & date range.
3. Surface list of Insight fields (dynamic from SDK Enum).
4. Query API and render table.
5. JSON export button.
6. Polish UI, logging, error states.
